"As an avid traveller I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling."

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important.
